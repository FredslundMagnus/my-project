### New self-help app
Meta Learn is a new self-help app that allows you to work on your mental well-being regardless of time and place. There are courses within stress, racing thoughts, depression, and anxiety disorders such as infection, exam, and disease anxiety.

### Interactive exercises
Meta Learn helps you identify your inappropriate strategies and habits that evoke and maintain your mental disorders. Meta Learn then suggests various interactive exercises personalized for you. You will get concrete tools to practice in your everyday life.

### New strategies
You will thus learn new strategies that are often quickly perceived as very useful and effective in improving your mental well-being. A good result depends on you practicing regularly and, thereby, integrating the strategies and methods acquired through the app.

### Self-help app for everyone
The strategies and methods in the app are helpful for everyone. It is normal to face resistance in life that affects our mental wellbeing to a greater or lesser degree. By knowing the strategies and methods in the app Meta Learn, and returning to them in critical situations in everyday life, you can prevent a mental disorder. You, therefore, do not need to have a mental disorder to be able to benefit from Meta Learn. It also has a preventive effect and, thereby, helps you maintain a good mental health.

### Metacognitive therapy and coaching
